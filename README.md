# Wallet App Services

This app allows users to register and login into a program that lets users store their credit/debit card information. It also saves session information, so users can log out, and it enables the user to make edits to their specific cards or profile, reflected in the database as well. This app was built to refresh and practice with the ReactJS frontend framework and Context API (wallet-app repo). The NodeJS/ExpressJS backend framework was also used to interface with PostgreSQL in order to better understand SQL microservices and databases.

Future plans for the project include improving the user interface and security measures, as well as simulating account balances and wireless transfers to other accounts.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the service in the development mode.\
API endpoints at http://localhost:3010.

Missing files include node_modules.
